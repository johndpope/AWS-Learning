include and suppress new lines
==============================

YAML uses “|” to include newlines while showing multiple lines 
		  “>” to suppress newlines while showing multiple lines. 
Due to this we can read and edit large lines. In both the cases intendentation will be ignored.


We can also represent Boolean (True/false) values in YAML. where boolean values can be case insensitive.
