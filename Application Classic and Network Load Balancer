Application Load Balancer
--------------------------
Allows containers to use dynamic host port mapping (multiple tasks allowed per container instance). 
Multiple services can use the same listener port on a single load balancer with rule-based routing and paths.

Network Load Balancer
-------------------------
A Network Load Balancer functions at the fourth layer of the Open Systems Interconnection (OSI) model. 
After the load balancer receives a request, it selects a target from the target group for the 
default rule using a flow hash routing algorithm.

Classic Load Balancer
------------------------
Requires static host port mappings (only one task allowed per container instance); rule-based routing and paths are not supported.
