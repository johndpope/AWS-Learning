I couldn't find a straight forward answer for how to use the parameterized Credentials Parameter username and password as 
environmental variables in a bash script. The following worked for me:

Add a Credentials Parameter. I called it "CREDENTIALS". Credential type "Username and password." Credentials Parameter Screenshot
In the Build Environment check "User secret text(s) or files(s).
Add a "Username and password (separated) binding. I set my Username Variable to USER and Password Variable to PW. 
For Credentials select "Parameter expression" and put in the name from step one. In this case it would be ${CREDENTIALS}.

Now ${USER} and ${PW} are available to the bash script.
